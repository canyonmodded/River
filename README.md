A set of libre Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 mappings, focused on the server. These
are used with [SpecialSource](https://github.com/md-5/SpecialSource).

## What can I do with this?

These mappings will form the basis of the Canyon modding platform. Canyon aims
to provide a more ergonomic developer experience for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 whilst
also bringing a careful touch of modernity to Beta 1.7.3.

By themselves, these mappings (which translate from obfuscated names from the
_Minecraft_ JAR to human-friendly names for use by Canyon) are not useful. But
when combined with other code, we can make modifications to the server.
